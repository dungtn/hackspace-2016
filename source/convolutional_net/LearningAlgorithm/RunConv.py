        The reason we store our dataset in shared variables is to allow
        Theano to copy it into the GPU memory (when code is run on GPU).
        Since copying data into the GPU is slow, copying a minibatch everytime
        is needed (the default behaviour if the data is not in a shared
        variable) would lead to a large decrease in performance.
